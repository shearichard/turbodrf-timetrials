# TurboDRF Time Trial 

## Summary
[TurboDRF](https://github.com/AlexanderCollins/TurboDRF) is intended to make buiding out API endpoint quicker and easier. The project is in a very early stage of development but I'm keen to see how well it works and that's what I'm doing to do in this repos.

## Associated works
When I first read about TurboDRF I thought of Carlton Gibson's [neapolitan](https://github.com/carltongibson/neapolitan), another 'django acclerator', although in neapolitan's case it's a tool to acclerate tooling up CRUD views, regardless I'm interested in ways that Django can be made better and faster to use so I'm happy to try TurboDRF.

## Virtualenv Management
[pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is in use as the virtualenv management tool.

## Linting
[flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) is used for code quality checking.

Be sure to check the .flake8 file for exclusions from the standard rules.

## Code Formatting
The [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is installed for automatted code formatting, if that's your thing.
